# Developer Portfolio


This is a full-fledged portfolio website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, [visual editor](https://docs.netlify.com/visual-editor/overview/) and the [Git Content Source](https://docs.netlify.com/create/content-sources/git/).


**This is achieved by:**

1. Adding an annotation property to the content objects at they're loaded (see `src/utils/content.ts`)
1. When rendering the page, each content sub-object is dynamically matched to the appropriate component. At this point, wrap each component with an annotation, based on the abovementioned content property. See `src/components/components-registry.tsx`.
