This project was done as part of an internship I pursued at Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology.

Spam message detection using machine learning is a crucial application in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and cybersecurity. This project involves building a model that can automatically classify messages as spam or not spam (ham) based on their content. The process typically begins with data collection, where a labeled dataset of spam and ham messages is gathered. Popular datasets include the SMS Spam Collection Data Set and the Enron Email Dataset. Once the data is collected, it undergoes preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, removing stop words, and converting the text data into numerical representations using techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) or word embeddings.

After preprocessing, the data is split into training and testing sets. Various machine learning algorithms are then trained on the training data, including traditional methods like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression, as well as more advanced techniques like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. Deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Transformers can also be employed for this task. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure they effectively distinguish between spam and ham messages. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are also performed to optimize the models' performance. The final model is then deployed in a real-world setting, where it can continuously learn and adapt to new types of spam messages, providing robust protection against unsolicited and potentially harmful communications.
